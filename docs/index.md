### About

#### who

Polymath lab is a researchlab and community who wants to bring creatives in touch with emerging technologies and together with them investigate how these new technologies can be of use to them or empower them. (Think AI, XR, web3.0, HCI)

**Technological generalists** combining forces with teachers from Luca, other researchers within KULeuven and the industry surrounding Luca school of Arts.

An open group for applied research consisting of:

- teacher-researchers (target: education)
- full-time researchers (target: workfield)

#### why

[Innovation is change](https://www.fguell.com/en/innovation-is-change/). These changes follow quickly on a wide scale of topics.

We want to research how these changes will affect the future of creatives:

- How do creatives position themselves against the changes and the use of the innovative technologies?
- How can the creatives be enabled to use these technologies, in an intended yet also unintended fashion?
- How can we stimulate peer-training and knowledge sharing?
- How can we influence the workfield to adopt these emerging technologies?
