The target of the different concepts is to indicate hypothetical projects within LUCA where Polymath places a crucial role.

First thing is to have a short slideware of the story of each concept. We use this as a starter for a brainstorm session:
- how does the concept link with LUCA?
- can we enable students?
	- how?
- can we enable teachers?
	- how?
- what do we research specific in each concept, what could be the return for future designers?
- how are we going to fund this?

this way **we're** trying to get:
- more acquainted and known in the LUCA environment
- a buy-in of LUCA people in future projects
- a better definition of what Polymath *could* be within LUCA and outer reach!
	- this way we can start to promote ourselves elsewhere?

We'll be planning a meeting with some interesting profiles @ LUCA.

* What do we expect as outcome of this meeting? 
	1. Initial thoughts on Polymath
	2. "Letter of intent" to further participate?
* What do we expect to find in the end of multiple meetings?
	1. Network
	2. Sales pitch ==> fixed with some slides
	3. Insights on how future projects can involve 
		1. teachers
